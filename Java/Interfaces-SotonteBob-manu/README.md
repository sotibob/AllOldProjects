# Instructions  

### Description:
This activity will help you understand when and how to use interfaces. You will use the Bird interface and implement it in a Duck class. You will provide implementation of the sound and name methods. Please follow the steps below:

## Steps
 1. Create a Duck class in a new file that utilizes our Bird Interface.
 2. Give functionality to our sound and name methods. The sound method should return "Quack!" and the name method should return "Duck". (Remember: That the return type of the methods must match the return type of the abstract method you are overriding.)


### Test:
You can use the code in the Main.java file to test your Duck class. The test will directly test your Duck methods without the need for any printouts.

#### Sample output:
```
Quack!
Duck
```
