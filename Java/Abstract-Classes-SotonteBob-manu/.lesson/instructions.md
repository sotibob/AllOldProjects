# Instructions  

### Description:
In this activity you will learn about how to use abstract classes. You will use the Instrument abstract class to create a Drums, Piano and Violin class. You can see the already created Guitar class as an example. Please follow the instructions in order given below:

## Steps
1. Make the drums, piano, and violin class. Create a new file for each one. All of these should extend the Instrument class.
2. In their sound method make sure to print out "Keys clank" for piano, "Strings twang" for violin, and "Drums go boom" for the drums.
3. Create an object of each new type of instrument that you created. This should be in the Main.java file.
4. Call the sound() method on each of the objects you just created.  

### Test:
Use the test provided. 

#### Sample output:
```
Strings thrum
Keys clank
Strings twang
Drums go boom
```
